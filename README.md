- virtualenv (optional but recommended)

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - On Windows:

## Usage

### Run the Development Server
Start the Django development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
Access the application in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.


### Create a Superuser
To manage the application via the Django admin panel, create a superuser:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Follow the prompts to set up your superuser credentials.

### Populate the Database
To populate the database with sample data, use the following command:
```bash
python manage.py movies_sample.json
```
Ensure the `movies_sample.json` file is located in the appropriate directory.

### Clean Up the Database
To remove all entries from the database, run:
```bash
python manage.py clean_db
```
This script will delete all movie-related data from the database.

### üé• Movies Catalog - Django REST API

This project provides a REST API to manage and browse movies.

#### üìå API Usage Guide

This project provides a REST API for interacting with the movie catalog. You can explore the available endpoints using **Swagger UI** at:

üîó **[Swagger API Documentation](http://localhost:8000/swagger/)**

#### üîë Authentication & Authorization

1. **Register a New User**  
   - Send a `POST` request to `/api/register/` with your username and password.

2. **Login to Get Access Token**  
   - Send a `POST` request to `/api/login/` with your username and password.  
   - The response will contain an **access token**.
   - 
3**Refresh Access Token**  
   - Send a `POST` request to `/api/token/refresh` with your previous token.  
   - The response will contain an **access token**.

4**Use the Token for Authorization**  
   - Copy the access token and include it in the "Authorize" section of Swagger.  
   - The token should be prefixed with `Bearer ` (including the space).  
   - Example:  
     ```
     Bearer your_access_token_here
     ```

#### üé¨ Available API Endpoints

##### üîç Public Endpoints (Require Authentication)
- **Get All Movies**: `GET /api/movies/`
- **Get movies using query**:`GET /api/movies/q=searchTerm`
- **Get Movie Details**: `GET /api/movies/{id}/`

##### üîß Admin Endpoints (Require Admin Privileges)
- **Add a New Movie**: `POST /api/movies/`
- **Delete a Movie**: `DELETE /api/movies/{id}/`

Ensure you have the correct authorization token before making requests. Happy coding! üöÄ


### üöÄ Deployment Options

This project can be deployed using multiple methods. Below is an option to containerize the application using Docker.

#### üê≥ Deploy with Docker

You can containerize the application using the provided `Dockerfile`. Follow these steps to build and run the application inside a Docker container:

1. **Ensure Docker is Installed**  
   - Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if you haven‚Äôt already.

2. **Build the Docker Image**  
   Run the following command in the project root directory (where the `Dockerfile` is located):
   ```sh
   docker build -t movies-catalog .
   ```

3. **Run the Container**  
   Start the application with:
   ```sh
   docker run -p 8000:8000 movies-catalog
   ```
   This will make the application accessible at `http://localhost:8000/`.

4.**Production Deployment**  
   For a production environment, you can provide an environment file to configure the application settings dynamically.

   The application supports the connection to a remote Postgresql database and AWS S3 bucket for media storage.

   The application assumes the server has all the permissions required (IAM Role) to access the database and the remote storage.
   If you are interested in direct access using AWS credentials, add them in .settings.py:

        `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID =os.environ.get("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID")
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=os.environ.get("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY")`

   - A sample environment file (`.env.sample`) is included in the project.
   - Copy and rename it to `.env`, then update the necessary variables.
   - You **must** set `ENV=production` to apply production-specific configurations.

   Example `.env` file:
   ```
   ENV=production
   AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=your-aws-bucket-name
   AWS_REGION=aws-region
   DB_HOST=postresql host
   
   ```

   Use the `--env-file` flag when running the container:
   ```sh
   docker run --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 movies-catalog
   ```

This ensures that the application is running with the correct production settings. üé¨üê≥üöÄ
